title: My first Post
---

That's actually the first real post of my blog. Right now I'm coding and writing everything from my father's old laptop (it's not really fast, neither slow), and the process of porting my old tools (and even some new ones, like [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), go and check that out) is taking a lot of time. I hope that I'll start updating that blog more often and that I'll also start posting pictures and stuff of some of my current projects (currently is to fix my Desktop PC and to prepare my bags for a 3 weeks trip in Ireland, Dublin).
